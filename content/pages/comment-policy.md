# Comment Policy  
Come one, come all, now post the ***considerate and appropriate*** to the bottom of the page and do what you wish with the rest.  

I use a free and generous service by Disqus, so please adhere to our combined wishes of no vulgarity, political correctness, and - *for me* - have it look like you at least read and can give the appearance of consideration toward what was written within its own context and limitations before taking off on something with a critique you find imperative or manifest destiny with you here as God's messenger to reinstruct upon me and the readers; really, its just you and me here anyways isn't it ;) ..
