## Intro  

Something happened. Something so beautiful it swept a peoples by the '-aww'  

A cloud of living motherly love  
Wrapped herself about such hope and expectation  
What became was exactly what was needed  

Fracture, something is wrong
"no ... no ... this can't be right.."
"something is missing"
...

The future  
It Was  
It was beautiful  
It was ..
was it
where is .

Something isn't here


## Timeline
2012 end of the year
On our trip of new zealand. Traveling around the north island. 
Green pastures. Shaving german rabbits. Rafting through tunnels of glowing worms. Staying on the lake. Eating Indian before bed.  

Everything was so great. Adventures through webs and dinosaurs, a maze of laughter as we loved each and every moment.  

Looking back it was almost as if we were hunted for what we had ever since that trip.  
Radios and spiritual witchcraft of the 21st century used to bend will and lead us like a mouse to cheese.
