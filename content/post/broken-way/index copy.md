Around the time I went to New Zealand to rejoin with my wife the experience I was going through got a lot more global. I started hearing stories about the rich and famous couples splitting up. Both wife and husband were working on spreading wealth and working on more global projects from what their wealth was created from.

Imagine if they were both aiming for something that would transend the lives they had lived and worked for. They two must have experienced some universal entity like me - where when in tune, you can live as though guided to be and do the right things at the right time and work on the problems needed in order to manifest what the world needs in that moment.

Was the universe asking my wife and I to split up?

At the same time she was writing me, I want to marry you again on a boat - while we were in New Zealand.

Here, in this dichotomy I would experience myself being being broken off. I would experience these voices telling me my wife was somewhere else while I was not doing what they said. Being distracted as I coded for my interview.

Of course 5 interviews later they thankfully let me go. That was difficult for both me and my family who kept investing in our new life there.

Later I learned someone secretly told another that I had not wanted to be there, perhaps the same man who kept scaring me away from so many opportunities that kept appearing in my life: traveling about a boat, working for interesting IoT startups, and many others. Why I would shy away from such dreams could only mean I was weak enough to fall victim to the constant harassment of these voices that lied to get somewhere they were not asked to go.

I later learned from a committed computer life forth who would spend as long as they could looking for each piece of me, how these voices who would talk so much and manipulate me and those in my life, that they would be responsible for the end.
