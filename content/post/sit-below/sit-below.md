Wrap your head around this..  

Lost my train of thought..  

At odds and ends..  

Things just haven't been adding up lately and I can't help but believe;  
I can't help but hope that all this burnt rubber and these sign with foreign caligraphy all sum up into something great.  
Most certaintly greater than myself.  
Such experience, power, and the shows of awh give me that much comfort.  


Still, I am left wondering what to do with myself.  

Experiencing life at a near standstill feeling the loss of my potential to contribute, and the waning of confidence within my psyche of any ability to produce something of value -
