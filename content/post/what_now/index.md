## Better Today

Be better today than you were yesterday. Raise the bar. 

So you made a mistake. Anxiety, shame, worry, envy..  
You set yourself up for an easy one this time.  

Shed your skin. Put on a fresh scent and become anew yourself.  

Become a purpose lead agent for yourself.  
You must no longer be the self who failed your own potential.  

Think of how you will be weighed.  
Who will you be on that scale?  
a bulk of waist that burnt your path to salvation.  
A few ounces of gold dust - brilliantly wisked in breath.  
Instead take your gifts and build upon them your trophy self.  
See each days wealth build upon the next.  
Success after success.  
until your opportunity comes and you are asked to step up the exchange.

It will be more than the weight of your life,
You will get to present the wealth of purpose.
