      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-today&#34;&gt;Better Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be better today than you were yesterday. Raise the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you made a mistake. Anxiety, shame, worry, envy..&lt;br&gt;
You set yourself up for an easy one this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shed your skin. Put on a fresh scent and become anew yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become a purpose lead agent for yourself.&lt;br&gt;
You must no longer be the self who failed your own potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of how you will be weighed.&lt;br&gt;
Who will you be on that scale?&lt;br&gt;
a bulk of waist that burnt your path to salvation.&lt;br&gt;
A few ounces of gold dust - brilliantly wisked in breath.&lt;br&gt;
Instead take your gifts and build upon them your trophy self.&lt;br&gt;
See each days wealth build upon the next.&lt;br&gt;
Success after success.&lt;br&gt;
until your opportunity comes and you are asked to step up the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be more than the weight of your life,
You will get to present the wealth of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
