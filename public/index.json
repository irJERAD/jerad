With an investment in the proper stationary brand-named product you can pull each and any note from surfaces to edit, adjust, remove or replace more times than there are permutations for its use. This is wonderful. It is one the first aspects that allows these products to transcend their stationary label and garner a cult following in business, art and home crafts circles alike.\nFor the purposes of this article I would like to share how I use the paper swiss army knife in my everyday notebook.\nI, as should everyone, carry around a small paper notebook for a myriad of uses: jotting down notes, quick TODO lists, phone numbers and names of people I may meet, grocery lists, uses uncountable. I am an absolute digital native. I used to wait in lines to get the newest iPhone models, I have an app for everything and develop apps for myself when I can find the excuse in a need. I even jot down my thoughts and opinions on a digitized journal which is posted online via this website. Yet still, I carry an analogue, handwritten in, paper notebook wherever I go - and I insist everybody else do the same.\nFor reasons that go beyond the scope of this blog post writing notes by hand, jotting ideas down on paper, building lists with a pen and pad, even if they are migrated over to a digital task management application shortly thereafter, writing by hand is the subconscious thought of kinesthetic body processes. And just like linguistic, communication oriented thought, subconscious processes are instrumental to its ability to so concisely orchestrate the many vast networks of neurons firing into comprehensible symbolic thought recognized by the conscious mind. Take it like this, hand written notes are the, eh, handwritten notes of your mind-bodies intended action. Of course your mind and body know just what they intend to do and how they intend to do so, however, in our cluttered and stimuli rich lives it is easy to get tripped up and lose ourselves in a moment or an afternoon and find ourselves lost to our earlier goals.\nIt is when you look back at your beeping of your phone to read an alert you wrote last week:\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to bring X over to Y\u0026rdquo;\nto which you respond with a wince followed by a:\n\u0026ldquo;Whaa\u0026hellip; t was I talking about?\u0026rdquo;\nA note written last week that started out as a handwritten note, however, has the added reinforcement of tactile and kinesthetic muscle memory to jolt context back into place.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah I remember being at the grocery store learning on the cart as I wrote down this note.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; and yes, yes, \u0026lsquo;Y\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nSo please, don\u0026rsquo;t get caught up on the perceived extra effort or excess material of an analogue notebook and carry it everywhere you go. Your context rich memory content will be there to reward you.\nFinally, now we can get on with the purpose of this post, to share with you how it is sticky-notes play powerful roles in my notebook and bring to life my paper toolkit.\nScrum Artifacts I am a huge proponent of the agile framework. I love agile and lean everything. I even take a lean approach to the kitchen and my fashion accessories and clothing. Efficient, Powerful, Agile, Intuitive, these are all words with powerful meanings that I feel all coalesce to an archetype of why I love the results I get from Scrum which bring to the collection: Context, Reflection, Projection, Iteration, and Assimilation.\nMost of us should be familiar with Kanban boards here. For those who aren\u0026rsquo;t:\nA Kanban board is like a TODO list that moves. It starts on the left with a column titled \u0026ldquo;TODO\u0026rdquo;, then moves to the center column \u0026ldquo;DOING\u0026rdquo; then finally it proceeds to the terminal third column: \u0026ldquo;DONE\u0026rdquo;.\nTo create and use one in your note book simply write out those three columns vertically across an open two pages in the notebook. Then, using Post-Its, write down a task item. Ideal task items are independent action oriented concepts or tasks that can be completed in and of themselves. This is important so that any single note can travel from \u0026ldquo;TODO\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;DOING\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Working On\u0026rdquo; then to \u0026ldquo;DONE\u0026rdquo; without needing other notes to travel with it.\nThis is a good way to look at your errands and tasks in general. Scrum is great at forcing you to see projects and goals through independent task oriented iterations. It allows you to breakdown the biggest of problems into short tasks that can be run independent of each other - great for distributed workload across teams or for accomplishing different items in different environments such as doing \u0026ldquo;work item at the office\u0026rdquo; and doing \u0026ldquo;family items at the house\u0026rdquo;.\nData Tables I love Disc Golf. So much so that I have been training, that\u0026rsquo;s not practice that is training ;-) and taking notes. When I am performing a putting exercise I track performance of my intervals on stick-notes. I use them because they stick to the tree, the ground, or even a disc, whever I need them to while I write on them or place them aside in order to putt. Afterwards, I rip the note off of whatever surface it was last and place it into my notebook. Generally it will find itself in similar company around other notes with grids of numbers and fractions representing previous scores and performance metrics.\nThe sticky-note is an amazing piece of office-ware turned cultural tapestry. So many people use them for so many things and to those who do they are absolutely essential.\nSimilarly the notebook is quintessential buffer for your mind. Offloading thoughts, comments, and tasks or expanding upon concepts and ideas into coherent narratives that someday live digital lives, eternally grafting their experiences to the minds of others who keep the cycle going and jot down their thoughts on the matter in a trusty notebook - full of sticky-notes I hope..\n","date":1621264200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621264200,"objectID":"1535895aa21acc961f77d1f033109da2","permalink":"https://jerad.xyz/post/my_notebook/","publishdate":"2021-05-17T15:10:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/my_notebook/","section":"post","summary":"One of the multiple real-world tools I throw into my notebook to extend its use.

I am focusing not on the game performance itself but on the users performance during routine exercises, drills, and specific activities key to the disc golf game.\nExamples include putting drills where I record the amount of successful attempts from different distances, measuring the length of my disc golf drive with different discs, tracking my encounters with instructional information from blogs and YouTube, and - of peculiar interest to me - I will be recording a regular wellness survey to measure my emotional and physical wellbeing as they are experienced by me.\nYou can check in on the status of the apps prototype as I release updates here: DGG\nI am developing the application in R, using libraries like Shiny and ShinyDashboard to create a reactive web app experience on a modern Dashboard UI.\nTime and resources permitting I would like to develop a final version as a native mobile application that can be released on the Apple App Store with the likes UDisc\nUntil then, I\u0026rsquo;ll be chucking rubber and plugging away at pulling insights from my training.\n","date":1620393360,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620393360,"objectID":"349726f97068177e35aa1d020fb1cfb7","permalink":"https://jerad.xyz/post/wish_list/","publishdate":"2021-05-07T13:16:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/wish_list/","section":"post","summary":"These are some things I hae thought about wanting to look into","tags":[],"title":"Wish List","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides academia\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

And whoever said a quote is an oversimplification and oftentimes used to promote a lifestyle that requires a complex set of heavily contextual aspects of living - oh that was me.\nEveryone seems to love quotes. Framed they adorn our halls ..\nPosters fill office break rooms; \u0026ldquo;Just hang in there\u0026rdquo; with little kitties dangling from a tree branch..\nSome love these synoptic collection of words so much they have them immutably etched into their bodies..\nBut quotes can be dangerous. These seemingly innocuous arrangements sway opinion, influence behavior and even sculpt one\u0026rsquo;s worldly views. That\u0026rsquo;s an awful lot of influence for something that persists without context or a speaker to clarify use in specific situations.\nQuotes That Sum Up To Encompass My Take On Life  If It\u0026rsquo;s Free Take Two\n This was a favorite of my step father. Attending surf competitions from a young age we use to love visiting the brand booths. They always had samples to peddle showing off wax, or surf combs and sometimes leashes or nicer gear; and of course the all-to-common sticker - I must have had over a hundred stickers from a single competition one time.\n No One Ever Said Life Was Fair\n As the story goes, my grandmother used to always tell this to my mother when she would moan about not having or doing something the Jones\u0026rsquo;s kids got to. A single mother grandma had to make the most out of the money they had.\n No One Ever Said Life Would Be Easy\n Likewise - a single mother herself - my mom used to tell me this one each and every-time I used to shrug about having to do something I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I should be my responsibility.\n Life Is But A Dream ..\n  Beyoncé 2015  lol, my wife and I love quoting this ever since Beyoncé\u0026rsquo;s HBO film, \u0026ldquo;Life Is But A Dream\u0026rdquo; came out. As much as we jokingly say it to one and other, we also know the truth of how true it really is. We have both traveled the world, gotten to do more than we could have ever wanted to and have two of the most loving families, now joined through our love. It really is some kinda fairy tail dream story and I don\u0026rsquo;t take that for granite ever!\n Hakuna Matata\n Making an appearance earlier on someones tattoo, this phrase is truly a Disney masterpiece. I love the song and frequent it on my play list, blasting it aloud from my car stereo. I believe every word of that song and strongly hold the phrase as a paramount life value.\n You are what you eat\n While I don\u0026rsquo;t have the best diet in the world I believe in this line in a multidimensional way. I believe you are what you eat, what you do, who you hang out with, what you read, where you came from, etc. I think this sums up contextually, that you are a product of your environment, as well as allowing you to get out what you put in to something. So here you are (currently), who you will be (future you) depends on what you do about it. I also believe we are fortunate to have so much to do about who we are and become; our capacity to take responsibility, nature designed us self-responsible, is an inherent gift.\n One o\u0026rsquo;clock, two o\u0026rsquo;clock, three o\u0026rsquo;clock rock\n It is always time to rock and roll. And I plan on doing so figuratively, metaphorically, literally and any other possible way I find to do so in the future. I love music and believe is connects us, like dancing, to forms of communication, self, culture, and the mind in a unique way. It is definitively therapeutic and has many added life values - like chic\u0026rsquo;s dig musicians that always helped.\n If you aren\u0026rsquo;t early, you\u0026rsquo;re late\n This is coming from someone notorious for being late. I must be subconsciously hooked on riding the clock - those who run out of gasoline more than they should know what I mean. I truth, being late is incredibly selfish. That is hard for me. I really identify as a giving and caring individual who likes to place others first, a servant leader. So when I am confronted with a characteristic that labels me as selfish I really have a hard time with that. Natural curse or illness I know not, I just want others to know I really do value your time and I love spending time with people so much. I just may offend you a little in the beginning is all. Promise I will make it up to you with validation and an honest desire to facilitate your agenda thereafter.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d10f9ea81d4ca27c7f5f8c2cf8148f02","permalink":"https://jerad.xyz/quotes/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/quotes/","section":"pages","summary":"WARNING: Before Using Please Read The Following: If a pictures worth a 1,000 words then how many sums up a mans take on life?
